This project revolves around using more advanced web design tools to update projects from freeCodeCamp. It reinforces fundamental skills in HTML and CSS and allows me to learn and reinforce more advanced skills such as integrating React libraries and CSS Frameworks.
This README lists file directories and the code inside. The basic form of the webpage will be displayed with the basename from freeCodeCamp. E.g, Cafe Menu is the base of the project. Cafe Menu_with_Updates would be my own personal takes on the project. 
In each update directory, there will be subdirectories containing individual reworks of the page as well as a description of what tools I am using in each and their functionality.

CatPhotoApp_with_Updates:
  - Change a base HTML page to a page with a database, Javascript UI library, an HTML templating language and a CSS framework.
  - Will utilize React, Bootstrap,React, React JSX and postreSQL
